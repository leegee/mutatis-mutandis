In the last decade of the eighteenth century, and in the first half of the nineteenth century, a number of words, which are now of capital importance, came for the first time into common English use, or, where they had already been generally used in the language, acquired new and important meanings.

...

There is in fact a general pattern of change in these words, and this can be used as a special kind of map by which it is possible to look again at those wider changes in life and thought to which the changes in language eviently refer.

-- Williams (1958)


...since the middle of the eighteenth century a profound change has occured in the meaning of the classical topics (topoi) of political discourse. ... What is posited is a threashold period (Sattelzeit) in which the past was gradually transformed into the present. Concepts registering change became "Janus-faced": facing backwards, they pointed to social and political realities no longer intelligble to us without critical commentary, facing forward to our own time, concepts have taken on meanings that may not need further explanation to be directly intelligible to us.

...

A defining experience of the modern world is a loss of those specific and particularistic terms which once designated social conditions. For this reason, many older concepts, increasingly over-taken by events or changes in social structures that they could no either longer articulate or explain, became more and more abstract.

...use of collective singular nouns [eg stories] ... [were] replaced by the more abstract [eg history].

-- Kosselleck (1972)
