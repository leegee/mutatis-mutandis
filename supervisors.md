## Supervisors - Material

### Dr. Alexandra Franklin

Role: Head of the Centre for the Study of the Book, Bodleian Library
Strengths:

Oversees many of the Bodleian’s major digitisation programmes.

Deep experience with pamphlet collections, cheap print, ephemera.

Pragmatic, DH-friendly, used to interdisciplinary candidates.
Fit:

Excellent. If your project involves building a digital corpus, a TEI pipeline, a WYSIWYG editor, computational analysis, or corpus-level novelty detection, she is the most institutionally aligned person.
Note: She is not a full-time academic supervisor but often co-supervises with a department member. Still, she is central to any pamphlet/digitisation project at Oxford.


### Professor Adam Smyth

Chair of English Literature & Book History
Specialisms:

Early modern print culture, pamphlets, ephemeral texts.

Material text, reading practices, cheap print.
Digital openness:

Very supportive of digital textuality, metadata, and editing.

Previously involved in digital textual initiatives.
Fit:

If your thesis centres on pamphlet rhetoric, political affect, and forms of communication during the Civil Wars, Smyth + Franklin would be a powerful combination: one for historical-literary framing, the other for archival/digital workflows.
