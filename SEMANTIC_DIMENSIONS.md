# Semantic Dimensions

## An Introduction to Induction of Koselleck‑style neighbour‑induced role framework.

Following Koselleck's analysis of recurring conceptual oppositions, this study treats such dimensions as heuristic axes along which distributional neighbourhoods cluster, permitting historically specific configurations to emerge rather than presupposing a fixed ontology.

Note: This does not preclude subsequent testing of a fixed ontology.

Our proposed methodology is to observe these emergent formations and describe them, rather than to search for particular forms a priori. Once the natural configurations have been identified, they can be compared to the encodings or embeddings of the expected correlations and neighbours.

## A. Temporal dimensions (his deepest commitment)

These are fundamental to Zeitschichten and Sattelzeit.

Experience <> Expectation
(Erfahrungsraum <> Erwartungshorizont)

Permanence <> Acceleration
(tradition, continuity <> rapid change, innovation)

Repetition <> Singularity
(cyclical history <> unprecedented events)

Past-oriented legitimation <> Future-oriented projection
(custom, precedent <> promise, programme, utopia)

These dimensions are where metaphors of movement, horizon, rupture, threshold cluster.

## B. Political–social dimensions

These are the most visible in Grundbegriffe entries.

Authority <> Participation
(rule, command <> representation, consent)

Hierarchy <> Equality
(estate, rank <> citizen, people)

Order <> Movement
(stability, peace <> reform, revolution)

Inclusion <> Exclusion
(citizen/subject <> enemy, outsider)

These dimensions generate metaphors of body, boundary, centre/periphery, ascent/descent.

## C. Normative dimensions

Here Koselleck is very close to legal and theological language.

Normativity <> Contingency
(law, right, necessity <> chance, circumstance)

Justice <> Power
(legitimacy <> force)

Obligation <> Freedom
(duty, command <> licence, autonomy)

These are especially important for pamphlet literature, where moral and political vocabularies interpenetrate.

## D. Semantic–pragmatic dimensions

These concern what concepts do, not what they “mean”.

Description <> Prescription
(naming a state of affairs <> calling for action)

Stabilisation <> Mobilisation
(conserving order <> inciting change)

Clarification <> Polemic
(definitional <> adversarial)

This is where Skinner aligns most closely with Koselleck.

## NB

Koselleck inherits (implicitly) a tradition running through:
* Blumenberg (metaphors as irreducible conceptual carriers)
* Schmitt (spatial and existential metaphors in politics)
* Classical rhetoric (topoi, oppositions, figures)
